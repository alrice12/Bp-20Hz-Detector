# Bp-20Hz-Detector
Acoustic energy detector for fin whale 20 Hz calls

Calculates the difference in acoustic energy between the signal (22 Hz) and background noise levels (average energy between 10 and 34 Hz) from a long-term spectral average (LTSA) in [Triton](https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton.git).

Outputs an average ratio for each day of the timeseries
